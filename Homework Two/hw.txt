Problem 2: The first 12 (r,c) coordinates popped off the stack by the algorithm are:

(3, 4)
(3, 3)
(3, 5)
(2, 5)
(1, 5)
(1, 6)
(1, 7)
(1, 8)
(2, 8)
(3, 6)
(4, 4)
(5, 4)

The top of the stack is popped first.


Problem 4: Given the same main function and maze as are shown at the end of problem 1, what are the first 12 (r,c) coordinates popped from the queue in your queue-based algorithm?

(3, 4)
(4, 4)
(3, 5)
(3, 3)
(5, 4)
(3, 6)
(2, 5)
(6, 4)
(5, 5)
(1, 5)
(7, 4)
(5, 6)

The stack-based algorithm employs a depth-first search strategy, which involves exploring the maze's deepest path before retracing its steps and attempting another path. It first explores the first cell on the stack until it either reaches the goal or a dead end before pushing each newly discovered unvisited cell onto the stack. It pops the last stack cell and investigates the next stack cell if it reaches a dead end. This go on until the objective is found or the stack is vacant.

The queue based algorithm investigates all potential ways at a given separation from the beginning cell prior to moving to the following distance. It places each newly discovered unexplored cell at the back of the queue and exploring the first cell on the queue until either the goal is reached or all of the cells at the current distance have been investigated. On the off chance that it arrives at every one of the cells at the ongoing distance without finding the objective, it moves to the following distance by dequeuing the principal cell from the line. This goes on until either the goal is reached or the queue is empty.
